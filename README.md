# Juwl | Product landing page

Fictional page created for the Responsive Web Design course from Freecodecamp. Designed by me.

## Resume 

This site was created for study purposes only, as a step towards completing the free codecamp responsive web development course. The purpose of the course is to learn HTML markup language and CSS styling. For this, I created, for example, an animation on the website of a rotating 3D cube (infinitely), as well as transitions with pure css, such as the sandwich menu inserted on the website, using the transform property and a checkbox or the arrow that appears after the hover over the "add to bag" button. The site also has media queries, CSS variables and is full responsive. You can take a look at [Juwl website](https://codepen.io/danielasegadilha/pen/dyqvNLZ?editors=0100)
